    "#### 2. What are the different forms of data used in machine learning? Give a specific example for each of them.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "There are four types of data used in machine learning:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Time Series data\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Text data\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1.Numerical data\n",
    "\n",
    "Numerical data is any data where data points are exact numbers. Statisticians also might call numerical data as quantitative data. This data has meaning as a measurement such as house prices or as a count, such as a number of residential properties in Los Angeles or how many houses sold in the past year.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### i. Discrete data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Discrete data has distinct values. eg: Number of students, Number of houses\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ii. Continuous data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Continuous data can assume any value within a range. eg: Height, Weight\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2.Categorical data\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data represents characteristics, such as a hockey player’s position, team, hometown. Categorical data can take numerical values. For example, maybe we would use 1 for the colour red and 2 for blue. But these numbers don’t have a mathematical meaning. That is, we can’t add them together or take the average.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### i. Nominal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Categorical data eg: Male, Female\n",
    "\n",
    "##### ii. Ordinal data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Order of the data matters but value doesn’t. eg: 1st place in the class\n",
    "\n",
    "##### iii. Interval\n",
    "\n",
    "Order matters, value also matters but natural zero is not present.\n",
    "\n",
    "##### iv. Ratio\n",
    "\n",
    "Something measured on a ratio scale, has same properties as interval scale but with absolute zero point.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3.Time Series data\n",
    "\n",
    "Time series data is a sequence of numbers collected at regular intervals over some period of time. It is very important, especially in particular fields like finance. Time series data has a temporal value attached to it, so this would be something like a date or a timestamp that you can look for trends in time.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: Sales forecasting, Investment prediction\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4.Text data\n",
    "\n",
    "Text data is basically just words. A lot of the time the first thing that you do with text is you turn it into numbers using some interesting functions like the bag of words formulation.\n",
    "\n",
    "eg: Email message segmentation"

    "Categorical data are values obtained for a qualitative variable. categorical data numbers do not carry a sense of magnitude.\n",
    "Numerical data always belong to either ordinal, ratio, or interval type, whereas categorical data belong to nominal type. - - Methods used to analyse quantitative data are different from the methods used for categorical data, even if the principles are the same at least the application has significant differences.\n",

    "\n",

    "Feature selection you just select a subset of the original feature set, without any manipulation of the data on the other hand.\n",
    "Dimensionality reduction is typically choosing a new representation within which you can describe most but not all of the variance within your data, thereby retaining the relevant information, while reducing theamount of information necessary to represent it."

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Histogram is a distribution plot which displays the frequency of the discrete or continuous numerical data with in a range. Means, here we devide the range of values with a bin size, which we consider randomly and displays the frequeny of the numbers in the plot.\n",

    "### 6. What are the various histogram shapes? What exactly are ‘bins' ?\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Ans: The different types of a Histogram are:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.Uniform Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "2.Symmetric Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "3.Bimodal Histogram\n",
    "\n",
    "4.Probability Histogram.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Bell-shaped:** A bell-shaped histogram, usually presents a normal distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Bimodal:** A bimodal shape histogram, has two peaks. This shape may show that the data has come from two different systems\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Right Skewed:** Some histograms will show a skewed distribution to the right, as shown below. A distribution skewed to the right is said to be positively skewed. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the lower value cells (left side) and few in the upper value cells (right side).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Left Skewed:** Some histograms will show a skewed distribution to the left, as shown below. A distribution skewed to the left is said to be negatively skewed. This kind of distribution has a large number of occurrences in the upper value cells (right side) and few in the lower value cells (left side).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Uniform:** An uniform distribution, as shown below, provides little information about the system. An example would be a state lottery, in which each class has about the same number of elements. It may describe a distribution which has several modes (peaks). If your histogram has this shape, check to see if several sources of variation have been combined. If so, analyze them separately. If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results. This could be as simple as changing the starting and ending points of the cells, or changing the number of cells. An uniform distribution often means that the number of classes is too small.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**.Random:** A random distribution, as shown below, has no apparent pattern. Like the uniform distribution, it may describe a distribution that has several modes (peaks). If your histogram has this shape, check to see if several sources of variation have been combined. If so, analyze them separately. If multiple sources of variation do not seem to be the cause of this pattern, different groupings can be tried to see if a more useful pattern results. This could be as simple as changing the starting and ending points of the cells, or changing the number of cells. A random distribution often means there are too many classes.\n",

    "###### The **bin** in a histogram is the choice of unit and spacing on the X-axis. All the data in a probability distribution represented visually by a histogram is filled into the corresponding bins. The height of each bin is a measurement of the frequency with which data appears inside the range of that bin in the distribution."

    "### 7. How do we deal with data outliers?\n",
    "\n",
    "### Ans:\n",
    "\n",
    "The outlier handling method can vary from case to case and should be discussed with the business before finalizing the method. There are different approaches such as replacing the outlier with the **mean value, mode value or median value** imputation or in some cases dropping the observation with the suspected outlier so as to avoid any bias in them. We tend to delete the outlier if they are due to data entry errors caused due to human error, data processing errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on the size of the data set it is advisable to treat the outliers separately during model fitting and build a different model which can fit the outliers and a separate model for the rest of the dataset but this process can be time-consuming and add to the cost."
