    "#### 2. Define probability of a union of two events with equation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The general probability addition rule for the union of two events states that P(A∪B)=P(A)+P(B)−P(A∩B), where A∩B is \n",

    "\n",
    "#### 3. What is joint probability? What is its formula?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:|** Probabilities are combined using multiplication, therefore the joint probability of independent events is calculated \n",
    "\n",
    "as the probability of event A multiplied by the probability of event B. This can be stated formally as follows:\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. What is conditional probability means? What is the formula of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Conditional probability is defined as the likelihood of an event or outcome occurring, based on the occurrence of a \n",

    "**Conditional probability** is calculated by multiplying the probability of the preceding event by the updated probability of \n",

    "the succeeding, or conditional, event.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a real-life example. Probability of selling a TV on a given normal day may be only 30%. But if we consider that \n",

    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A continuous random variable X takes all values in a given interval of numbers. ▪ The probability distribution of a \n",

    "#### 7. What are Bernoulli distributions? What is the formula of it?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** A **Bernoulli distribution** is a discrete probability distribution for a Bernoulli trial — a random experiment that \n",

    "has only two outcomes (usually called a Succes or a Failure).The expected value for a random variable, X.\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 8. What is binomial distribution? What is the formula?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** The binomial is a type of distribution that has two possible outcomes (the prefix “bi” means two, or twice).For \n",
    "\n",
    "example, a coin toss has only two possible outcomes: heads or tails and taking a test could have two possible outcomes: pass or \n",

    "**Ans:** A **Poisson distribution** is defined as a discrete frequency distribution that gives the probability of the number of \n",

    "\n",
    "In statistics, a Poisson distribution is a probability distribution that is used to show how many times an event is likely to occur over a specified period. ...

    "### 10. Define covariance ?\n",
    "\n",
    "**Ans:** Covariance is a measure of how much two random variables vary together. It's similar to variance, but where variance \n",
    "\n",
    "tells you how a single variable varies, co variance tells you how two variables vary together.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 11. Define correlation ?\n",
    "Ans: Correlation explains how one or more variables are related to each other. These variables can be input data features which have been used to forecast our target variable. It's a bi-variate analysis measure which describes the association between different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "12. Define sampling with replacement. Give example.\n",
    "Ans: If you sample with replacement, you would choose one person's name, put that person's name back in the hat, and then choose another name. The possibilities for your two-name sample are: John, John. John, Jack.\n",
    "\n",
    "13. What is sampling without replacement? Give example.\n",
    "Ans: In sampling without replacement, each sample unit of the population has only one chance to be selected in the sample. For example, if one draws a simple random sample such that no unit occurs more than one time in the sample, the sample is drawn without replacement.\n",
    "\n",
    "14.What is hypothesis? Give example.\n",
    "Ans: A hypothesis (plural hypotheses) is a proposed explanation for a phenomenon. For a hypothesis to be a scientific hypothesis, the scientific method requires that one can test it. ... Even though the words \"hypothesis\" and \"theory\" are often used synonymously, a scientific hypothesis is not the same as a scientific theory.\n",
